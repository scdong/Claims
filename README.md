Claims is an open source parallel main-memory database that provides efficient data analysis. 

Claims runs on clusers of shared-nothing commodity multicore servers, which are interconnected by network, e.g., 1000M/10000M Ethenet network. As the in-memory data processing throughput is several orders of magnitudes faster than network bandwidth, network communcication is considered as the major performance bottleneck in our system.
